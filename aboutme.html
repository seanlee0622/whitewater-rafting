        <h2>"Sean"</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Sean Lee. I am majoring in Data Science. I am married with my beautiful wife, and we are having a baby boy in June. I am from South Korea, but now I live in Rexburg.</p>
        <p>I am currently working at the Career Center in BYU-Idaho as a data analyst. Most of time, I am using R and Python languages. Sometime, I collect data, create dashboards that includes some insightful graphs. By creating them, I use it to help people make better decisions for the needs.  </p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for entire my life. I love the gospel and am thankful for the truth that the family can be together forever.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are watching movies, going for a walk with my wife, and eating my favorite ice cream. I also love cooking and my favorite food is absolutely Korean BBQ. </p>
